#Loading Time Perception
##An open letter to [Menlo Innovations]
=========

I recently noticed that the your main site loaded slower then expected. When I looked at where most of the load time was going I noticed that your background image was rather large. I posted a quick note about it on your facebook page on Friday night and you had resized the image and replied to my post by Sunday.

I was impressed that you guys took notice and took action to change it so quickly.

When I went back to check on the page the load time was reduced but I realized the real problem wasn't just that the image was large. It was that it loaded in **visibly** slowly. I also noticed that while the backgrounds on all your other pages were 1920x1200 the new resized image was 1680Ã—1050. The reduced size had presented black bars on the side of the page.

####Slow Background loading

####Undesirable Borders

To fix the background border issue you can move the background tag out of the body into it's own styled div:

###old html
```html
<body id="homepage" onload="javascript:headerLinks(document.location.href);" style="background:#000000 url('img/bkgrd/collage-2014-01.jpg') no-repeat fixed center top"> 
```

###new html
```html
<body id="homepage" onload="javascript:headerLinks(document.location.href);"  style="background:#111111" > 
<div id="bg">
  <img src="img/bkgrd/collage-2014-01.jpg" alt="">
</div>
```

###css
```css
#bg {
  position: fixed; 
  top: -50%; 
  left: -50%; 
  width: 200%; 
  height: 200%;
}

#bg img {
  position: absolute; 
  top: 0; 
  left: 0; 
  right: 0; 
  bottom: 0; 
  margin: auto; 
  min-width: 50%;
  min-height: 50%;
}
```
This creates a nice static background that remains static independent of resolution
####Before
![Alt text](/files/expand_arrow.JPG "Image call example")    
####After
![Alt text](/files/expand_arrow.JPG "Image call example")    
   
The background popping in can be fixed by having the image load in the background and after it's fully loaded, have it fade it in.
```js
    $(window).load(function(){
    $('<img/>').attr('src', 'img/bkgrd/collage-2014-01.jpg').load(function() {          
    	    $('#bg').fadeIn(200); //200 ms fade in time
		});
	});
```

But we have to set the background to initially not be shown (style="display:none").
```html
<div id="bg" style="display:none">
  <img src="img/bkgrd/collage-2014-01.jpg" alt="">
</div>
```
####Before
![Alt text](/files/expand_arrow.JPG "Image call example")    
####After
![Alt text](/files/expand_arrow.JPG "Image call example")

As a note, that javascript as it is would have to be added to each page. It could be placed into an anonymous function that can be passed the background image as a parameter and loaded via a script tag. That way if you have to change the transition time for the background you can do it from a single place.

I hope this helps. Of course this is a bit more work but it makes a world of difference for the experience. Contact me if you need any details.
